Twitter Bot for Susi

The idea of this project is to have a bot for AskSusi on Twitter, in the language of your choice. The bot should be able to work both on Twitter's Direct Messages, and as direct replies (when tweeted to). Since direct replies have a 140 character limit, the reply should have the link of the actual reply from the Susi API incase it exceeds the 140 characters, i.e the bot should reply as "<some portion of the reply> <link of the full reply>". For direct messages, you should display the entire reply.
